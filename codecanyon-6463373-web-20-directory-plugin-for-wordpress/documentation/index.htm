<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To add a WordPress Plugin using the built-in plugin installer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to "<em>Plugins -&gt; Add New</em>".</li>
<li>Click "Upload Plugin" button.</li>
<li>Choose downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now" button.</li>
<li>Make sure that you click on "Activate the plugin", now you have installed directory plugin.</li>
<li>Create new page with <strong>[webdirectory]</strong> shortcode or with <strong>[webdirectory custom_home=1]</strong> if you wish to build <a href="#custom_home">custom home page</a>. Also you may create additional pages with <strong>[webdirectory-submit]</strong> and <strong>[webdirectory-dashboard]</strong> shortcodes if you wish your logged in users to manage their listings, invoices and profile on the <a href="#frontend">frontend dashboard page</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Special note</strong>: additional pages with <strong>[webdirectory-submit]</strong> and <strong>[webdirectory-dashboard]</strong> shortcodes must not have main directory page with <strong>[webdirectory]</strong> shortcode as parent.</p>
<h4>How to update</h4>
<p>First of all download the latest version of the plugin from Codecanyon. Simply unpack the archive with new version and upload all new files and folders to your plugin folder on the server (usually the name of folder is "<em>wp-content/plugins/codecanyon-6463373-web-20-directory-plugin-for-wordpress/</em>"), that is all, the system will automatically execute required operations. All files and folders must be uploaded using FTP-client (like FileZilla) or using file manager in your hosting control panel. It would be better to make backups of the database and all plugin files before update. All your configurations, settings and data will be saved after update, you will not lose anything. Files modifications must be made according to <a href="#customization">customization instructions</a>, in such case they will be saved during update.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="getting_started">Getting started</h2>
<p>So you get your instance of the plugin installed and ready for use. Now lets set up most important settings and options. Note that you may manage and change following settings in any time you want, but it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recommended to set up before your directory site becomes public</span>. Here is some recommendation on how to get familiar with the plugin in right way:</p>
<ol>
<li>first of all configure your directory using special built in <a href="#directory_settings">settings</a></li>
<li>set up <a href="#listings_levels">listings levels</a>, by default there is one "<em>Standard</em>" level</li>
<li>manage existing core fields and create additional <a href="#content_fields">content fields</a> for your needs</li>
<li>build your own <a href="#directory_categories">directory categories tree</a> and tags</li>
<li>work with locations: define <a href="#directory_locations">directory locations tree</a> and look at locations levels</li>
<li>create some test <a href="#directory_listings">listings</a> and explore how listings behave themselves at the frontend, which additional options and tools they have</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="directory_settings">Directory settings</h2>
<p>First of all look at "<em>Directory Admin -&gt; Directory settings</em>" page. There are some separate tabs with own groups of settings.</p>
<h3>General settings tab</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3752" src="assets/settings.png" alt="settings" width="523" height="604" />There are 3 available addons, if you do not need unnecessary functionality - do not enable them:</p>
<p><strong>Frontend submission &amp; dashboard addon</strong> - allow users to <a href="#frontend">submit new listings</a> at the frontend side of your site, also provides users dashboard functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Payments addon</strong> - includes payments processing and invoices management functionality into directory/classifieds website.</p>
<p><strong>Ratings addon</strong> - ability to place ratings for listings, then manage these ratings by listings owners, also ability to rate comments/reviews.</p>
<h4>Titles, Slugs and Permalinks</h4>
<p><strong>Directory title</strong> - this string will appear in the title of all frontend pages related with the directory plugin. This will be rewritten when WP SEO by Yoast plugin was activated.</p>
<p><strong>Listing slug</strong> - this is a part of URL for single listing page, for example, in this URL <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/web-listing/listing/</em> <strong>listing</strong> - is the name of listing and <strong>web-listing</strong> - is the slug. Listing slug take part in some permalinks structures, see below about listings permalinks structure.</p>
<p><strong>Category slug</strong> - this is a part of URL for categories sections, for example, in this URL <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/web-category/business/</em> <strong>business</strong> - is the name of category and <strong>web-category</strong> - is the slug.</p>
<p><strong>Location slug</strong> - this is a part of URL for locations sections, for example, in this URL <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/web-place/united-states/los-angeles/</em> <strong>united-states/los-angeles</strong> - is the path of locations tree and <strong>web-place</strong> - is the slug.</p>
<p><strong>Tag slug</strong> - this is a part of URL for tags sections, for example, in this URL <em>http://www.yoursite.com/<em>directory/</em>web-tag/service/</em> <strong>service</strong> - is the name of tag and  <strong>web-tag</strong> - is the slug.</p>
<p><b>Notice about slugs:</b> Slugs must contain only alpha-numeric characters, underscores or dashes. All slugs must be unique and different.</p>
<p><strong>Listings permalinks structure</strong> - set up permalinks structure of single listings pages. Examples of listings URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/%postname%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/listing-name/</em></li>
<li><strong>/%post_id%/%postname%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/644/listing-name/</em></li>
<li><strong>/%listing_slug%/%postname%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/business-listing/listing-name/</em></li>
<li><strong>/%listing_slug%/%category%/%postname%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/business-category/listing-name/</em></li>
<li><strong>/%listing_slug%/%location%/%postname%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/business-place/listing-name/</em></li>
<li><strong>/%listing_slug%/%tag%/</strong> - <em>http://www.yoursite.com/directory/business-tag/listing-name/</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>/%postname%/</strong> works only when directory page is not front page. When following structures is activated: <strong>/%listing_slug%/%category%/%postname%/</strong>, <strong>/%listing_slug%/%location%/%postname%/</strong> and <strong>/%listing_slug%/%tag%/%postname%/</strong> only first category, location or tag of the listing is used.</p>
<h4>reCaptcha settings</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>login required</strong> - logged in users have an ability to manage their listings, invoices and profile on the frontend dashboard page.</li>
<li><strong>necessary to fill in contact form</strong> - after successful submission WordPress creates new user profile. If user with entered email already exists in the system - it doesn't required to create new profile and listing will just be assigned with existed user. Later admin may manage and contact new user when needed. For new users registration email with newly generated password will be sent.</li>

<p>When claim request was sent – notification about claim for this listing will be sent to the current listing owner.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="directory_categories">Directory categories</h2>
<p>Site admin may create/edit/delete special categories items. Management of directory categories tree has exactly the same functionality as standard WordPress categories, but these are separate items and have special administration page "<em>Directory listings -&gt; Directory categories"</em>.</p>
<p>Also custom icons may be associated with directory categories:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-891" src="assets/categories_icons.png" alt="categories_icons" width="588" height="115" /></p>
<p>By default there are 77 icons files inside "<em>resources/images/categories_icons/"</em> folder of the plugin. Site administrator may upload additional icons in this folder via the Files manager of hosting control panel or via FTP.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="directory_locations">Directory locations</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways to provide locations functionality on directory site:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Use predefined locations</strong> - this way users will be able to select for their listings only previously defined locations, autocomplete on addresses fields and "Get my location" button on addresses fields disabled, also search by address must be disabled on search form. So addresses fields will be used only to enter streets, buildings, postal codes, e.t.c.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Use addresses fields</strong> - do not insert predefined locations. Users will work only with addresses fields, autocomplete function and "Get my location" button on addresses fields will help them. Addresses fields will contain whole information about country, state, city, region, streets, buildings, postal codes e.t.c. In this way default radius search value would be quite useful to get nearby locations in search results.
</li>
<li>
<strong>All in one</strong> - usage of predefined locations and addresses fields. But in such case information in addresses fields may contain country, state, city, region, the same as selected predefined locations.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Predefined locations</h3>
<p>Site admin may create/edit/delete special predefined locations items. Management of directory locations tree has exactly the same functionality as standard WordPress categories, but these are separate items and have special administration page "<em>Directory listings -&gt; Directory locations</em>"</p>
<p>After locations levels were successfully configured and locations tree completed - users may select any predefined location from select boxes group on create/edit listing page.</p>
<p><img src="assets/predefined_locations.png" alt="predefined_locations" width="640" height="147" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3779" /></p>
<p>Note, that there is an ability to select more than 1 location for each listing.</p>
<h3>Locations levels</h3>
<p>Just in some words, locations levels - these are names of nesting levels of directory locations tree. By default there are 3 locations levels: Country, State and City. Site admin has an ability to edit/remove or create new locations levels. But note, that in most of cases, whole chain of locations is required to set correct location point on Google maps. This means that when your directory will be used locally, for example, for users of only one country or state/region - do not delete unnecessary locations levels and locations, they are required to set correct location point at the Google map during listings creation. You'll just exclude needed locations levels from address line - yes, there is such option for each locations level, it allows to build custom address line at the frontend:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="assets/locations_levels_addresses2.png" alt="locations_levels_addresses" width="449" height="129" /></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="listings_levels">Listings levels</h2>
<p>Levels of listings control the functionality amount of listings and their directory/classifieds conception.<br />
Each listing may belong to one of defined levels, some may have eternal active period, have sticky status and enabled google maps, others may have greater number of allowed attached images or videos. It is perfect base for business model of your directory or classifieds site. On "<em>Directory Admin -&gt; Listings levels"</em> page you may order existed levels by drag &amp; drop rows in the table, the order of levels affects on levels pricing table. Here is the list of listings levels options:</p>
<p><strong>Level name</strong> - uses in the levels pricing table on the 1st step of listings creation. Special note: by default there is one standard listing level after installation of the plugin and the system doesn't show pricing table on the 1st step of listings creation, because it doesn't need to select the level for newly created listing.</p>
<p><strong>Level description</strong> - uses only in the advertise table on the 1st step of listings creation.</p>
<p><strong>Active period</strong> - in years, months and days. During this period the listing will have active status, then the status of listing become expired. After expiration listing owner or admin may prolong and renew listing.</p>
<p><strong>Eternal active period</strong> - when enabled - listings of this level will never become expired.</p>
<p><strong>Ability to raise up listings</strong> - if this option is checked - listing owner or admin may raise listing up in all lists those ordered by date.</p>
<p><strong>Sticky listings</strong> - if this option is checked - listings of this level will be always sticked on top of all lists those ordered by date.</p>
<p><strong>Featured listings</strong> - listings of this level have special css class "<em>w2dc_featured"</em>, may be customized to be highlighted and attract attention.</p>
<p><strong>Do listings have own pages?</strong> - this option could disable listings self pages, so there will not be any links to listings pages, just that information on excerpt pages.</p>
<p><strong>Enable nofollow attribute for links to single listings pages</strong> - any links to listings will not be indexed by search engines. <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569" target="_blank">Description from Google Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Enable google map</strong> - users have an ability to place location(s) marker on Google map.</p>

<h2 id="content_fields">Content fields &#038; content fields groups</h2>
<p>Additional content fields is one of the most important part of the directory and classifieds sites. They allow to add some piece of information to directory listings. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also content fields take part in the search of listings</span>.

<p><img src="assets/content_fields.png" alt="content_fields" width="829" height="138" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3785" /></p>
<p>Each content field belongs to the type that defines its behaviour and display. You may hide field name, select custom field icon, set field as required, manage visibility on pages. Also listings may be <a href="#ordering">ordered by some fields</a>. Note that you may assign fields for specific categories and/or specific levels.</p>

Site administrator may upload additional icons in this folder via the Files manager of hosting control panel or via FTP.</p>
<p><strong>Field type</strong> - it is possible to change field type, but only for non-core fields.</p>
<p><strong>Is this field required?</strong> - most of types of fields can be set as required and some can not - listings categories, listings tags, listings addresses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Category-specific content fields</h3>
<p>As was told earlier, it is possible to set some fields (<em>except core fields</em>) to function only when exact specific categories were checked on listings administration page. The same functionality appears at the search block. This is important and powerful feature allows to build category-specific content fields.<br />
<strong>For instance:</strong> there may be one <em>‘price’</em> field especially in <em>‘Classifieds/For sale’</em> category and all its subcategories, so this field will appear only in listings, those were assigned with those categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Content fields groups</h3>
<p><img src="assets/content_fields_groups.png" alt="content_fields_groups" width="401" height="474" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3792" /></p>
<p>This functionality allows to combine separate content fields into groups (including core fields). There is an ability to place content fields group on a separate tab on single listing page, also ability to hide content fields group from anonymous users - they will only see the link to login page <em>"You must be logged in to see this info"</em>.</p>

<h2 id="directory_listings">Directory listings</h2>
<p>Listings of the directory very much like standard WordPress posts, except some things and additional features. Creation of new listing begins with choosing of listing level <em>(when there are more than 1 level in the system</em>). This is the first step and it defines functionality and behaviour of  newly created listing.</p>
<h3>Listings creation and management</h3>
<p>Listings administration page may contain standard fields and metaboxes such as: title field, richtext editor for listing description, slug and excerpt fields, comments metabox. Also, according to the level of current listing, this page contains special metaboxes: listing categories, listing locations, content fields, media metabox with forms for images uploading and YouTube videos embedding.</p>
<p>When you click "<em>Publish</em>" button on the listing administration page - the system tries to save listing details, when all required conditions were kept (<em>all required fields completed, matched their formats and location, categories, images, videos items do not exceed their limits</em>) - the listing will be saved successfully, the listing status becomes "<em>active</em>" and the system sets expiration date (<em>when the active period of level of current listing is not eternal</em>). If something goes wrong - the post status becomes "<em>draft</em>" and warning message with the list of issues appears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note, that title field is required.</span></p>
<p>Each directory listing has special metabox on its administration page:</p>
<p><img src="assets/listing_info_metabox1.png" alt="listing_info_metabox" width="288" height="224" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3798" />"<em>Listing Info</em>" metabox have some information fields: chosen listing level, listing status, order date and expiration date.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">listing status IS NOT the same thing as post status</span>, listing status may be "<em>active</em>", "<em>expired</em>" or "<em>unpaid</em>". Post status may be "<em>published</em>", "<em>pending review</em>" or "<em>draft</em>".</p>
<p>After expiration date has passed listing status become "<em>expired</em>" and post status become "<em>draft</em>" - users can not edit them from frontend dashboard while it wasn't renewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may see "<em>raise up listing</em>" and/or "<em>renew listing</em>" links on each listing row on "<em>Directory listings</em>" page and "<em>Listing Info</em>" metabox. Also there may be a link to change listing level (if it is possible by listings upgrade settings). "<em>Directory listings</em>" page has a bulk action to change listings levels.</p>
<p><img src="assets/administration_listing_row.png" alt="administration_listing_row" width="927" height="121" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3799" /></p>
<h3>Raise up listing option</h3>
<p>This option displays when the level of current listing has "<em>Ability to raise up listings</em>" enabled setting. This feature will raise up the listing to the top of all lists, those ordered by date. For more information look at the <a href="#ordering">sorting section</a>. This feature may be <a href="#payments">payment.</a></p>
<h3>Renew listing option</h3>
<p>This option displays when level of current listing has not enabled "<em>Eternal active period</em>" and current listing is under "<em>expired</em>" status. This feature processes directory listing renewal. After renew process was completed successfully the listing status becomes "<em>active</em>" and the system sets new expiration date. Also this function raises up the listing to the top of all lists, those ordered by date. This feature may be <a href="#payments">payment.</a></p>
<h3>Listings upgrade</h3>
<p><strong><em>"Directory Admin -> Listings upgrade"</em></strong> page contains following table with options:</p>
<p><img src="assets/listings_upgrade.png" alt="listings_upgrade" width="789" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3803" /></p>
<p>This feature may be <a href="#payments">payment</a>, just set prices for listings upgrade according to their levels. It is possible to disable levels upgrade. Also after successful upgrade listing may be raised up. When this service is not free - successful upgrade means when invoice was completed and paid.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="search">Search block and advanced search block</h2>
<p>Search block is divided in 3 sections: "<em>What search</em>", "<em>Where search</em>" and "<em>Advanced search block</em>". You may hide each section or separate search fields - there is a group of settings on <a href="#directory_settings">search settings tab</a> of directory settings page.</p>
<h3>What search section</h3>
<p>This section includes keywords search field. Also allows to use categories filter and search by <a href="#content_fields">content fields</a>, not all content fields have an ability to search listings by their values.</p>
<h3>Where search section</h3>
<p>There are locations search filter and "<em>Search by address or zip code"</em> field in this section. "<em>Search by address or zip code"</em> field is the autocomplete field, this helps users to choose item from existed addresses or zip codes.</p>
<h3>Advanced search block</h3>
<p>This block is hidden by default and used only for search by <a href="#content_fields">content fields</a>. You may choose to hide search content field under "<em>Advanced search</em>" link in order to make search block a bit smaller when there are lots of search fields enabled.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ordering">Sorting of listings</h2>
<p>Each frontend page that displays the list of listings has "<em>Order by</em>" set of links.</p>
<p><img src="assets/orderby.png" alt="orderby" width="821" height="84" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3763" /></p>
<p>By default on the top appear sticky and featured listings only when they sorted by date, in other case they sorted exactly by title, rating, additional content fields values, but there is such option <em>"Sticky and featured listings always will be on top"</em>. So it is additional tool for commerce model of the directory site - place listings of sticky or featured levels higher than other listings. Then at the second stage each list sorts by date (<em>here may be useful "raise up listings" feature</em>), except search by radius page. When user searches listings in radius - default sorting is by distance from center point.</p>
<p>Some <a href="#content_fields">content fields</a> also may take part in sorting. Clicking sorting links allows to change order direction from ascending to descending and vice versa.</p>
<p>You may find special sorting settings including "Default order by" setting on <a href="#directory_settings">"Pages &amp; Views" tab</a>.</p>
<p>When ratings addon enabled - in the "<em>Order by</em>" set of links appears new option to order by listings rating.</p>
<p>Special attention to <em>sticky</em> listings - they are have higher priority under featured and other listings.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="maps">Google Maps and marker icons</h2>
<p>By default each frontend page renders map when there are any listings with assigned locations and defined markers. Also it is possible to disable maps on index or excerpt pages in <a href="#directory_settings">directory settings</a>.</p>
<p>Here is simple example of how Google map looks with custom marker icons and special radius search layer:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944" src="assets/google_map.png" alt="google_map" width="625" height="353" /></p>
<p>When appropriate <a href="#listings_levels">level setting</a> is checked (<em>Custom markers on google map</em>) - during listings creation/edition users may select custom marker icons. By default there is 1 subfolder with icons files inside "<em>w2dc/resources/images/map_icons/icons/</em>" folder. Site administrator may upload additional icons in this folder via the Files manager of hosting control panel or via FTP.</p>
<p>During listings creation/edition there is an option to set marker coordinates (<em>latitude and longitude</em>) manually or by drag &amp; drop of existing marker by mouse.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945" src="assets/listing_locations_generate_map.png" alt="listing_locations_generate_map" width="460" height="424" /></p>
<p>Clicking "<em>Generate on google map</em>" button processes targeting and compiling of addresses to render markers on the map.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="frontend">Frontend dashboard and listings submission</h2>
<p>These features become available when "<em>Frontend submission &amp; dashboard addon</em>" was enabled.</p>
<p>Create new page with <strong>[webdirectory-dashboard]</strong> shortcode if you wish your logged in users to manage their listings, invoices and profile on the frontend dashboard page.</p>
<p>"<em>Submit new listing</em>" button appears on front panel, clicking this button - users start the process of listing creation divided in some steps. Note, that the page with <strong>[webdirectory-submit]</strong> shortcode required.</p>
<p><strong>Special note</strong>: additional pages with <strong>[webdirectory-submit]</strong> and <strong>[webdirectory-dashboard]</strong> shortcodes must not have main directory page with <strong>[webdirectory]</strong> shortcode as parent.</p>
<p><img src="assets/submission_plans.png" alt="submission_plans" width="1176" height="583" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3822" /></p>
<p>Number of submission steps varies according to different conditions: log in step may be missed if user was already logged in, payment step either doesn't required for free listings. After successful submission new listing will be created and in case of payment listing user will be redirected to invoice page to select payment gateway. According to "<em>Post status after frontend submit</em>" setting listing post status will become: Pending Review, Draft or Published.</p>
<p>There are <a href="#directory_settings">some settings</a> for frontend submission addon.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="payments">Payments</h2>
<p>This option becomes available only when "<em>Payments addon</em>" was enabled.</p>
<p>Invoices management page appears at the backend. Authors have access only to own invoices, administrators have permissions to manage any invoices. With enabled "<em>Frontend submission &amp; dashboard addon</em>" users may manage invoices at their frontend dashboard page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1070" src="assets/directory_invoices.png" alt="directory_invoices" width="625" height="384" /></p>
<p>Each invoice has one of following statuses: unpaid, pending or paid. Invoice item - is an object to which this invoice belongs to.</p>
<p>There are 5 types of pay services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>listings activation</strong> - this type of service available for subscription and one time payment. After successful payment the listing status becomes “<em>active</em>” and displays at the frontend.</li>
<li><strong>listings renewal</strong> - this type of service available for subscription and one time payment. This feature processes directory listing renewal. After renew process was completed successfully the listing status becomes “<em>active</em>” and the system sets new expiration date.</li>
<li><strong>listings raise up</strong> - this is the service for one time payment. This feature will raise up the listing to the top of all lists, those ordered by date. For more information look at the <a href="#ordering">sorting section</a>.</li>
<li><strong>listings upgrade</strong> – this is one time payment service. Charge users if they wish to upgrade their simple listings to featured or sticky.</li>
<li><strong>listings claim</strong> – after successful approval of claim new owner need to pay to renew the listing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Invoice management page provides whole information about current invoice: the reason of invoice, invoice item, invoice status, author, price, item options, also invoice log - this is the history of actions processed with this invoice. Also taxes information available when taxes functionality was enabled.</p>
<p>Users are allowed to process some actions with invoices, such as print invoice with all assigned information or reset selected gateway. Also there is special action button "<em>Set as paid</em>" only for administrators. This allows to set up invoice status as paid manually and processes further actions. Usually this needed to complete invoices with chosen "<em>Bank transfer</em>" payment gateway.</p>
<p><img src="assets/payment_gateways.png" alt="payment_gateways" width="1142" height="235" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3824" /></p>
<p>Available payment gateways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PayPal</strong> - this method for one time payment.</li>
<li><strong>PayPal subscription</strong> - users may use this method to process automatic recurring payments. Look at additional information below.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe</strong> - a beautiful, optimized, cross-device, payment form.</li>
<li><strong>Bank transfer</strong> - this is semi-automatic method of payment. User selects this method, prints invoice, transfers the payment to vendor, then when site administrator will receive payment - he will manually set invoice as paid by special action button "<em>Set as paid</em>".</li>
</ul>
<h4>PayPal Subscriptions</h4>
<p>Using this payment gateway directory listings owners do not need to prolong their ads each time they have been expired. They may choose to open subscription and pay automatically by recurring cycle. The only condition is that PayPal accepts only one duration unit - this means that active period of listings for subscription must be only in days, months or years, in other case active period may be rounded. So <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is recommended to set active period only in days, only in months or only in years</span>. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>advertisement active period 3 days and 2 months - rounded to 2 months</li>
<li>advertisement active period 15 days, 2 months and 1 year - rounded to 14 months</li>
<li>advertisement active period 30 days and 1 month - rounded to 1 months</li>
<li>advertisement active period 30 days - this will not be rounded</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please note, that PayPal subscriptions available only for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">listings, those do not have eternal (unlimited) active period</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Special note</strong>: PayPal single payment and PayPal subscriptions require enabled permalinks on WordPress "<em>Settings -&gt; Permalinks</em>" page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After activation of payments module - on <a href="#directory_settings">directory settings page</a> new tab "<em>Payments</em>" will appear with payments settings.</p>

<h2 id="widgets">Directory widgets</h2>
<p>Web 2.0 Directory plugin provides 4 types of widgets: listings, categories, search and social. Each widget type has own settings. Title setting is common for all widgets, also one common setting "<em>Show only on directory pages</em>", by enabling this setting the widget will appear only on directory pages: home directory page, categories and tags listings pages, search page, single listing pages.</p>

<h2 id="custom_home">Custom Home Page</em></h2>
<p>By default the order of content blocks of <strong>[webdirectory]</strong> shortcode can not be changed: search form, categories block, google map, listings block. But there is a possibility to set up custom layout.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2989" src="assets/custom_home_page_structure.png" alt="custom_home_page_structure" width="580" height="474" /></p>
<p>When you set up <strong>[webdirectory custom_home=1]</strong> – the shortcode displays only listings, no map, no categories block, no search form. This special mode allows to build custom directory home page as you wish using additional shortcodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[webdirectory-categories custom_home=1]</strong> - categories shortcode renders corresponding categories navigation menu.<strong><br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>[webdirectory-map custom_home=1]</strong> - Google map with custom_home=1 parameter displays markers of assigned listings locations from <strong>[webdirectory custom_home=1]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin is fully compatible with WordPress Visual Composer plugin, this is the best way to build pages using VC plugin with its amazing backend editor.</p>
<p><img src="assets/visual_composer.png" alt="visual_composer" width="1234" height="142" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3826" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>The customization of the directory does require some experience with HTML, CSS and even PHP to change the templates around to an arbitrary theme look. Plugin templates are designed to work relatively well with most themes, but if you do have the need to override these templates to match your theme please try to follow these conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to change the layout or styles of directory section on your site do not modify existing CSS files, instead copy them and give exactly the same name to new file, just add "<em>-custom</em>" postfix to the end of name before file's extension. For example, <em>w2dc/resources/css/frontend.css</em> file must be named <em>w2dc/resources/css/frontend-custom.css</em>. Using such method will save your modifications during further updates</li>
<li>the same convention for any templates - .tpl files in "<em>w2dc/templates/</em>" folder. For example, custom "<em>w2dc/templates/frontend/index.tpl.php</em>" template must be named "<em>w2dc/templates/frontend/index-custom.tpl.php</em>"</li>
<li>other part of customization is that you may manage <a href="#directory_categories">categories icons</a>, <a href="#directory_locations">locations icons</a>, <a href="#maps">map markers icons</a> and <a href="#content_fields">content fields icons</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of CSS files on frontend pages has following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/resources/css/bootstrap.css</em></strong> - basic CSS rules</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/resources/css/frontend.css</em></strong> - main file, controls the layout of directory markup</li>
<li><strong><em>wp-content/uploads/w2dc-plugin.css</em></strong>,  special CSS file for dynamic plugin options</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/resources/css/frontend-custom.css</em></strong> - (optional)  custom main fronted file</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_payments/resources/css/payments.css</em></strong> - CSS file from payments addon</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_payments/resources/css/payments-custom.css</em></strong> - (optional) custom CSS file for payments addon</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_ratings/resources/css/rater.css</em></strong> - CSS file from ratings addon</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_ratings/resources/css/rater-custom.css</em></strong> - (optional) custom CSS file for ratings addon</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_fsubmit/resources/css/submitlisting.css</em></strong> - CSS file from frontend submission addon</li>
<li><strong><em>w2dc/addons/w2dc_fsubmit/resources/css/submitlisting-custom.css</em></strong> - (optional) custom CSS file for frontend submission addon</li>
</ol>
<p>The directory has special customization settings to change some elements on frontend pages like links and buttons colors, backgrounds of search, categories, locations blocks, primary color, jQuery UI style and so on.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="change_texts">How to modify texts and strings</h2>
<p>If you use WordPress in English and simply want to modify texts and strings of the plugin follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>open "<em>wp-config.php"</em> file. This is the base configuration file of the WordPress</li>
<li>modify one line <em>define('WPLANG', ''); </em>to <em>define('WPLANG', 'en_US');</em></li>
<li>close file and save changes - it must be saved in UTF-8</li>
<li>now you are able to work with default *-en_US.po files and modify any texts and strings using <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank">poEdit</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always backup *-en_US.po and *-en_US.mo files in order to save your changes after plugin upgrade.</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="translations">Translations &amp; Multi-Language Support</h2>
<p>Web 2.0 Directory plugin is fully adapted for translations - look at "<strong><em>languages/</em></strong>" folder with .pot and .po files. Use <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank">poEdit</a> to translate .pot files. The process of translation is similar to <a href="#change_texts" target="_blank">modifying texts and strings</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>duplicate the .pot file and rename it to <em>W2DC-lang_COUNTRY.po</em></li>
<li>Example for the referenced plugin case: <em>W2DC-pt_BR.po</em><br />
    -- pt_BR means Portuguese Brazil, but many languages don't have a country variation...<br />
    -- you'll have to fill in with your own language</li>
<li>WPLANG in "<em>wp-config.php</em>" file must be set to your language, e.g., <em>define('WPLANG', 'pt_BR'); </em></li>
<li>Every time you save the .po file, PoEdit automatically generates a .mo file, which is the one WordPress uses and basically the only one you need to upload</li>
</ol>
<h3>WPML</h3>
<p>The plugin fully compatible with WPML plugin. It allows to easily translate directory listings, directory categories, tags, predefined locations. Also users may manage listings translations at the frontend of the site.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-2746 size-full" src="assets/translations.png" alt="translations" width="565" height="501" /></p>
<p><strong> Note:</strong> main directory page must have translations in those languages you wish to operate. The same thing with dashboard and submission pages.</p>
<p>When user clicks "Add translation to ..." button <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2749" src="assets/add_translation.png" alt="add_translation" width="16" height="16" /> - new copy of <span class="gt-baf-back">corresponding</span> listing in selected language will be created. This will be exact copy of listing from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">original</span> language, directory categories, locations and content fields assigned with this listing will be copied either.</p>
<p>Note, that listing operations are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strongly connected beetween translations</span>, this means that when user or admin clicks to activate, renew, raise up, change listing level or when the active period of listing expires - all related translations also will process these oprations. But content of translations is independent, also each translation may be deleted independently.</p>
<p>When WPML plugin is active - new setting appear on Advanced tab of directory settings page:</p>
<p><strong>Enable frontend translations management</strong> - this allows to manage translation directly from frontend dashboard.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="import">CSV Import</h2>
<p>We place sample CSV file into "<strong><em>documentation/</em></strong>" folder in the plugin archive.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the second step of importing you'll collate CSV headers of columns with existing listings fields, this means there isn't fixed format for CSV files.</li>
<li>The only required columns in CSV file those define new listings titles and level IDs. Also information about author must be provided - in any column of CSV file or by setting existed author in import settings.</li>
<li>In order to assign categories/tags with each listing - specify category/tag slugs in one CSV column and separate them with special delimiter. This delimiter must be any string character, but not the same as the delimiter for separation of CSV columns.</li>
<li>You may set to auto-create new directory category/tag. In such case, when there isn't any existing category/tag with provided slug - new root category/tag will be created automatically and that string in the CSV column will be used as category/tag name.</li>
<li>MultiValues - are such fields, those may have more than one value, for example, checkboxes content field. Separate them in one CSV column with special delimiter in the same way as for assigned categories.</li>
<li>Also you may upload ZIP archive with images files for new listings. Specify names of images files in one CSV column and separate them with special delimiter in the same way as for assigned categories. Note, that images files must be in the root inside ZIP archive, not inside folder.</li>
<li>By default listings authors will be specified in one of CSV columns, there must be existed user ID, user login or user email. Also you may switch to assign all new listings with one specific existed user.</li>
<li>2 possible ways to import addresses and locations for new listings: define already existed directory location ID or you may select up to 4 address parts in different CSV columns (e.g., building number in one column, street in another column, city in separate column, ......). Also you may set special column for names of existed map icons files: for example, there is such map marker icon file "<em>w2dc/resources/images/map_icons/icons/_new/Boat.png</em>", so you have to place "<em>_new/Boat.png</em>" into CSV column.</li>
<li>When you do not have latitude/longitude information for Google Maps markers - Google geocoding service may be used to build markers points from addresses (CURL extention required), but you can only import maximum of 2500 addresses per day, this is the max query limit of the Google geocoding service, unless you have a Google Maps API business license.</li>
<li>There is an option to configure all imported listings as claimable, this option is shown when frontend submission addon was enabled and also claim functionality was switched on.</li>
<li>When the size of your CSV file is very large - this may slow down the server and break the process of import, you may try to split the file into smaller CSV files.</li>
<li>Recommended to make whole backup of the database before import.</li>
